# Tasks5 – Spec-Kit Generated Project

This directory contains the files generated by GitHub’s spec-kit tool as required for the final phase of the project. The project was created in a separate repository using the `spec-kit` initializer and then copied here according to the assignment instructions.

The `.specify`, `.github`, and `.vscode` folders were generated by spec-kit. No manual modifications were made to the structure, as this directory is intended only to demonstrate the use of the spec-kit tool and not to replace the main PKMS/task manager implemented in tasks1–tasks3.
